#### Keeping my dotfiles orgnized

Just seems like a good idea as these are the result of months of small realizations and 
tweaks and research. 

For setup, simply clone the repo into any directory, and create a soft link in the home 
directory. Will require some path changes on a different machine, but the imortant bits
will be there.
